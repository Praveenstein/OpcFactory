# Virtual OPC Factory

This is a python based module to create virtual factory with OPC Support, that can be used to test smart manufacturing solutions before directly deploying it
in an actual factory. This is written using Salabim, a discrete event simulation package and opcua-async an asynchronous OPC UA client and server 
based on python-opcua.
